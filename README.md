# 🛰️ Satellite Monitoring & Real Estate Prediction System (Demo)

This repository showcases a **demo version** of a Satellite Monitoring System integrated with **real estate price prediction**. The goal is to leverage satellite imagery to detect environmental factors like deforestation or urban development, and combine it with AI-powered models to forecast real estate value trends.

> ⚠️ This is a **demo** version. The full-stack implementation (frontend + backend + AI pipeline) is currently under development.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This system is designed to:
- Monitor environmental changes using satellite imagery (e.g., deforestation, mining, construction).
- Use AI/ML models to **predict real estate property values** based on surrounding features and geographic data.
- Lay the foundation for a full-stack application with geospatial intelligence and market insights.

## 🌐 Tech Stack (Planned for Full Version)

- **Frontend:** React.js, Leaflet.js (interactive maps)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **ML Models:** Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Deep Learning)
- **Satellite Imagery:** Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel Hub API, NASA Earthdata
- **Object Detection:** YOLOv8, DeepLabV3 for incomplete building identification

## 📁 Current Demo Includes

- Basic satellite data processing logic
- AI model integration setup (prediction based on demo inputs)
- Sample geospatial data
- Code for parsing and visualizing prediction results

## 🔧 Setup (Demo)
